Dimdwarf Application Server
===========================

Dimdwarf is a lightweight application server, written in Java. You write single-threaded, event-driven POJO code - the server makes it multi-threaded, persisted and transactional. The programming model is the same as on [Project Darkstar](http://www.projectdarkstar.com) (now [RedDwarf](http://www.reddwarfserver.org)) and all Dimdwarf applications can be deployed on Darkstar with minimal modifications. The primary target audience is developers of online multiplayer games.
