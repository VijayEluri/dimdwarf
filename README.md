Dimdwarf Application Server
===========================

Dimdwarf is an unintrusive distributed application server for Java. You write single-threaded, event-driven POJO code - the server makes it multi-threaded, persisted and transactional. The primary target audience is developers of online multiplayer games. The programming model is the same as on [Project Darkstar](http://www.projectdarkstar.com) (now [RedDwarf](http://www.reddwarfserver.org)). Dimdwarf applications can be deployed on Darkstar with minimal modifications and vice versa.
