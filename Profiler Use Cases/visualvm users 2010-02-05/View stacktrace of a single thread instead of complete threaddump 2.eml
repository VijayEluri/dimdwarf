The area where I run into this sort of thing the most is where you have 
many request threads in a server and you really want to click on one and 
see lots of information about it without hopping all over.

At the JMX level all the pieces are there (except something to generate 
a nicely formatted stack trace, but that's easy enough to write).  The 
issue is that at a jconsole or VisualVM level the usability is pretty 
rotten.

We ended up with our own jconsole plug-in for this sort of thing.  
[jconsole provides enough capability to write such a plug-in yet keeps 
things a lot simpler than trying to write a VisualVM plug-in.]

Can you please describe in more details, why do you need this feature?
I have to say that I did not find it very useful so see thread dump for
just one thread in JConsole and I prefer to have thread dumps for whole
JVM. This give you complete picture of what is going on. As Jirka
already said, TDA plugin can display thread dump in a structured way,
where you can see master-detail view of thread and their thread dumps.<br>
    <br>
