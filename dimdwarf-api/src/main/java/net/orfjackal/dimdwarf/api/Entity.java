 * Classes annotated with {@link Entity} will maintain their identity when stored in the database.

 * By default, entities should be referred only through their interfaces, because the system will replace
 * entities with proxy objects when they are persisted in the database. To create proxy objects which extend
 * the concrete class of the entity (instead of only implementing its interfaces), specify {@link ProxyType#CLASS}
 * as a value for this annotation.
